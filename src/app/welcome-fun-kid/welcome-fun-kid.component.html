    <p><i>"I was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) Mk 4 in March 2011.
    My symptoms were bruising on my body and nose bleeds, a sign that my platelets were low.
    Mine was blue-lighted to William Harvey Hospital in Ashford where he was found to have leukaemia.
    I was then transferred by paediatric ambulance to Addenbrooks in Cambridge almost 150 miles away from
    friends and family where I was to be diagnosed as Acute Myeloid Leukaemia MK 4, an aggressive type of
    blood cancer with a less than average survival rate.
    I was finally declared "medically cured" in May 2017, five years to the day of his transplant.
    The Royal Marsden have declared me "their miracle" and one of the doctors said in 25 years of medicine
    and haematology,
    he had never seen anyone with such a bad cancer go through to a cure."</i></p>
